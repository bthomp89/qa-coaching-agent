Subject: Inconsistent Access to SecureVault — Okta Group Sync Partially Failing 
Customer Message 
Hi, 
We have a critical access issue across our "DataOps" and "ComplianceAudit" Okta groups. Roughly half of the users in each group are getting a 403 "Access Denied" when trying to log into SecureVault. The rest can log in normally. 
We checked Okta — group membership looks correct, and SCIM sync says "Success" from this morning. We didn't change any roles or entitlements. 
We're mid-audit for SOC 2. I need this resolved fast — we cannot afford downtime with our internal audit team locked out. 
Thanks, 
Jason 
Agent Response (Tier 1 Agent — Julia) 
Hi Jason,
Thanks for reaching out, and I'm sorry to hear about the access issues. Just to confirm — the affected users are all within the same two Okta groups? Have you had your Okta admin revalidate group assignments and SCIM settings? 
Sometimes stale metadata causes SCIM to "succeed" but silently skip changes. Try manually syncing the group again and clearing your app cache. Let us know if the issue persists. 
Best, 
Julia 
Customer Response 
We already tried re-syncing groups and cleared app metadata. Still the same issue. Also, the problem is not consistent — one user logged in fine this morning and was blocked 20 minutes later. Another couldn't log in, then suddenly got access an hour later. 
Our CISO is now involved and wants a timeline + explanation. Please escalate. 
Agent Response (Tier 2 Engineer — Mike) 
Hi Jason, 
Thanks for the update and additional detail. That fluctuation does sound unusual. It's possible that your SCIM token is partially expired — we've seen issues where older SecureVault orgs had tokens that were not auto-rotated. 
Please go to: 
Admin → Integrations → SCIM → Regenerate your token and update it in Okta. Once that's done, run a full re-sync. This should realign all group memberships. Let me know how it goes. 
Cheers, 
Mike 
Customer Response
Mike — I already regenerated the SCIM token last week, and we re-synced this morning. Issue still happening. 
Please dig deeper. This looks like something is intermittently breaking on your side — not Okta's. Users don't randomly gain and lose access. 
Also, this happened to us six months ago — and your team said it was a race condition in your role evaluation engine. Is that back? 
Agent Response 
Thanks for the follow-up. I wasn't aware of the prior incident, but I'll review our internal logs for any recent regressions related to the role engine. 
In the meantime, can you provide user emails for 3 affected and 3 unaffected users? That will help isolate the issue. I'll escalate to Engineering if I find anything in the logs. 
Appreciate your patience. 
Customer Final Message 
Sent the user list. Please do not ask us to "retry sync" again unless you've confirmed a root cause. We're under scrutiny and cannot explain uncertainty to our auditors. 
Also — please log this as a Sev 1 and give me a ticket ID I can reference in tomorrow's audit debrief.
